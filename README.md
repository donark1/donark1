### Hi there ðŸ‘‹!
  Thank you for visiting my GitHub page.   My Name is Don Ark and I have worked in the technoology field for well over 20 years.   I am currently an IT Manager looking to expand in other aspects of technology,  specifically coding! I look forward to the challenges of the vast world of coding and hopefully set my mark.  I am inquisitive and eager to learn.
